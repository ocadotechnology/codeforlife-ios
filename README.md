## Testing
This project was created when Swift 1.2 was the latest stable version, which does not contain a UI testing tool. Several testing frameworks had been included in this project to provide both unit tests and UI tests.

### KIF

### Quick
This framework also include another framework, called Nimble.

### XCTest
The original testing framework introduced by Apple is mainly used for testing struct. While it is not as human-readable as Quick, this framework comes in handy when it comes to basic struct tests.
